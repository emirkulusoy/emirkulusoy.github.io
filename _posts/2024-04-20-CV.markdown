## Summary of Achievements

● A Patented SW for Big Data and Machine Learning: LTE PIM catcher - Patent# 10009784 Link: https://patents.justia.com/assignee/yupana-inc  
● Developed several real-time tools/automation for the Ericsson Amos/Python languages to cut down on diagnostic and action times, as well as the need for additional field re-visits, manlift rental days, and other associated costs. Twenty+ field teams save over $100,000+ annually.  
● Developed an indoor(point 2 point) and outdoor(GPS) 5G/LTE/WiFi test tool for the iPerf(TCP/UDP) & FTP testing on linux platform. Per license, this tool saved $15,000. Through an SSH connection, 5G/LTE data (serving cell, quality, signal level, band, etc.) is gathered over the Cradlepoint R1900 Modem(CPE). Throughput is collected via curl (FTP) / iperf (TCP/UCP). nmcli and iwconfig are used to obtain WiFi information.  
● By creating an indoor and outdoor map report solution on the commercial free GIS/PyQGIS platform, license costs were reduced by $5,000 per user. qchainage, mmqgis modules are utilized.  
● To cut down on the amount of time needed for text/xml file comparisons, many parsers have been built using Python regex. By these tools, the engineers were able to increase their productivity in day-to-day jobs by ~5-10%.  

## Skills

● Experienced in using Machine Learning & Data Science Python libraries, including numPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PySpark, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib, seaborn, django, statsmodels, openpyxl, csv, docx, pillow, xml.  
● Employed sophisticated SQL and ETL techniques in complex database structures, data lakes, data warehouses, and SAP BI reporting tools to evaluate data, resolve inconsistencies, and ensure data integrity.  
● Created UiPath several scripts to automate test scenarios at RPA (Robotic Process Automation) projects.  
● Strong knowledge of using Agile and Scrum approaches to conduct tests for Test Driven Development (TDD) and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). CI/CD experience with Jenkins.   
● Advance reporting skills on Business Object, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau, and Excel.  
● Carried out assessments in the data management and analytics domains: Test Planning, Test Automation, Data Testing, Analytics Validation, Performance Testing, Integration Testing, Regression Testing, Reporting and Documentation.  
● Expertise in about time series analysis, including forecasting, smoothing, cyclical, seasonal, and stationarity analyses.  
● Monitored and documented the connections between issue reports, test setups, business needs, and technological requirements.  
● Executed e2e project coordinating(organizing, running, and taking part in daily meetings to inform all project stakeholders.).  
● Experienced with data cleaning, preprocessing, validation, visualization, data stores & structures, ETL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Snowflake, BigQuery, Cloud data platform.   
● Proficiency in Software Testing: creating strategies/scenarios, gathering information, API testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), creating/distributing results.  
● Hands-on experience with hardware configuration, evaluate/test, post-processing, initial analysis, test result validation and report creation for cellular (WiFi/Bluetooth/LTE/5G NR/CBRS/GPS) NWs OTA (over-the-air, on the field) and RF box (at the laboratory) testing methods for RAN equipment, Apple/Android phones, modems, etc.  
● Trained about Kubernetes troubleshooting, CNI (container network interface), YAML files, ETCD, configuration, scheduler, storage kinds, control plane, ingress & egress, secret, PV, PVC, kube-proxy, kubectl, etc.  
● Developed web-based solutions to save engineering costs by connecting Google Forms and the Google Apps script platform (JavaScript) to generate reports, charts, and calculations that are sent automatically via email.  
● Minimizing word/excel/presentation reporting duration by automatic report templates for several 3rd party tools.  
● Developed SSH/VPN solutions with subprocess, paramiko libraries and simple Django applications at Python.  
● Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) through Udemy course and exam.  
● Fluent about data structures; Binary Search, Hash Table, Sliding Window & Optimized Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Linked List, Stack, Deque, Tree, Binary Search Tree, Binary exponentiation, etc.  
● Excellent communication abilities and documentation skills.  
● Good knowledge of statistical analysis, machine learning, and probability theory.  
● Examine, record, and evaluate client demands to make sure the procedure satisfies them.  
● Skilled in solution consulting, sales engineering, and technical sales.  
● Support the sales team by locating and securing revenue opportunities, composing RFI/RFQ/RFP responses, and offering technical guidance all along the sales process.  
● Preparation and analysis of schematics. Practical knowledge in soldering components.  
● Created and organized Open RAN NW system testing using standardized lab equipment. Practical expertise of RF test tools (such as a site master, VNA, power meter, OTDR and spectrum analyzer).
