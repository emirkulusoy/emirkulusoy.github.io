## SUMMARY OF ACHIEVEMENTS

● A Patented SW for Big Data and Machine Learning: LTE PIM catcher - Patent# 10009784 - Link: https://patents.justia.com/assignee/yupana-inc
● Developed several real-time tools/automation for the Ericsson Amos/Python languages to cut down on diagnostic and action times, as well as the need for additional field re-visits, manlift rental days, and other associated costs. Twenty+ field teams save over $100,000+ annually.
● Developed an indoor(point 2 point) and outdoor(GPS) 5G/LTE/WiFi test tool for the iPerf(TCP/UDP) & FTP testing on linux platform. Per license, this tool saved $15,000. Through an SSH connection, 5G/LTE data (serving cell, quality, signal level, band, etc.) is gathered over the Cradlepoint R1900 Modem(CPE). Throughput is collected via curl (FTP) / iperf (TCP/UCP). nmcli and iwconfig are used to obtain WiFi information.
● By creating an indoor and outdoor map report solution on the commercial free GIS/PyQGIS platform, license costs were reduced by $5,000 per user. qchainage, mmqgis modules are utilized.
● To cut down on the amount of time needed for text/xml file comparisons, many parsers have been built using Python regex. By these tools, the engineers were able to increase their productivity in day-to-day jobs by ~5-10%.
